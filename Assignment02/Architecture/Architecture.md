# The C4 model for visualising software architecture
The C4 model is a helpful way to visually show and explain how software systems are structured. It uses different diagrams to break down the parts of the system, how they fit together, and how they work. This helps everyone understand the system better and talk about it more clearly.

## System Context Diagram for Galaxy TV+ Architecture:
The System Context Diagram for Galaxy TV+ Architecture provides an overarching depiction of the platform and its interconnectedness with external entities. At its core, Galaxy TV+ is represented as a central entity surrounded by various external dependencies, including users, devices, and other systems. This diagram offers a comprehensive view of how Galaxy TV+ interfaces with its environment, facilitating a better understanding of its place within the broader ecosystem.
